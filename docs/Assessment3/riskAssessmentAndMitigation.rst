Risk Assessment and Mitigation
==================================

**Highlighted changes:**

- Each risk now has a responsible risk owner
- Improved description as to how we came up with the risks and improved formatting
- More details are in the updates report

Introduction
-------------
Risk management is an important part of any project, we must prepare for
what could happen during the course of the project in order to be able
to quickly recover and stay on track. The risks which are shown below
take into account the scale of the project and aim to cover only risks
which are realistic within this context.

To determine risks we brainstormed various scenarios - such as a
teammate being ill for more than a few weeks. From these scenarios, we
collected possible risks, and worked out the likelihood of them
occurring. To determine the risk we discussed how it would impact the
project, focussing on how many knock-on effects the issue would cause.

The risks are presented in a tabular format, with the following columns:

-  **Risk ID** - this allows for traceability across the project
-  **Description** - describes what the risk is for
-  **Likelihood** - each risk has an estimated likelihood on a scale

   -  **High** =good chance this risk will occur, about 75% chance
   -  **Medium** =equal chance of risk occurring or not, about 50% chance
   -  **Low** =not likely to occur, about 25% chance, however some risks may be lower

-  **Impact** - this describes the impact the risk would have to progress in
   the project
-  **Severity** - shows the severity of the impact on the project on a scale

   -  **High** =a major setback which could affect the whole project
   -  **Medium** =could add up to a week of extra work and may threaten a deadline
   -  **Low** =may mean a few extra hours of work, but nothing major

-  **Mitigation** - describes how how we will aim to avoid such a risk and
   deal with it
-  **Owner** - describes the owner of the problem, where the owner is the
   person most likely to be responsible for the issue.

The overall table is split into sections which group together similar
risk such as software risks. Each section is then ordered by severity,
highest first. Equal severity is ordered by likelihood.



This table will be regularly consulted in an attempt to monitor the
risks and try to ensure they do not occur and catch them early if they
are occurring.

Due to the size of the team we feel that these risks are appropriate and
accurate.
