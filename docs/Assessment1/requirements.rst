Requirements
============

Introduction
-------------

First the team read the brief and associated documentation. Then we got
together and discussed our ideas, coming up with a rough draft of basic
and requirements. From these we discussed the more ambiguous points,
such as what sort of view the player will use, and where the murder will
take place. Then we picked out the most ambiguous parts that prevented
us from continuing with basic designs and discussed them with our
customer. After two interviews with our customer we finalised the
requirements.

At the first group meeting we played cluedo to get a feel for a general
detective game. This sparked great discussion, and allowed for great
strides to be made on requirements very early on, by giving us an idea
of what works in a game. This also allowed us to discuss ideas that
would be interesting but more difficult to implement, which we left as
possible expansion if overall time costs do not overrun. We also
produced a number of user scenarios[1] which we used to help guide our
thinking when producing requirements.

After discussing our ideas on clues for a bit, as a group we decided
that the most effective way of deducing the murderer was to attempt a
‘guess who’ style. This way the player can cross off certain NPCs upon
finding clues that confirm their alibis. This should allow the player to
feel as though they are actually solving the crime, rather than just
witnessing the solving.

The requirements are sorted into two tables, functional and
non-functional. Functional requirements are things that the system does,
so mainly requirements for when the game is running. Non-functional
requirements are things that the system is, so mainly qualities the game
must have, or objects that are hard coded.

The tables below are numbered using the following system:

*  The first number is category (The bit in bold e.g. NPCs)
*  The second number represents ‘must(1), should(2), could(3)’ (the
   priority of achieving the requirement)
*  The third number is the requirements position in the list (to make it
   easier to find and refer to)

The requirements are laid out in tables based on the IEEE standard for
system requirements for ease of access. By giving each requirement a row
and a number all information is easy to find quickly in future. Any and
all associated risks are discussed in the risks document and are
referenced in the tables.

Some requirements are based on considerations of environmental
assumptions of the game. Requirements based on hardware have all taken
into account the systems that the game will run on. We produced a survey
[2] which we got a small number of our target market to answer. From
this we found that the preferred way of interaction with the game was
keyboard and mouse. Although our survey produced no results of
colourblind people, it is a condition apparent in 1 in 12 men and 1 in
200 women [3] so we still feel that it is a requirement that some people
would benefit from, hence why it is listed as ‘could’.
