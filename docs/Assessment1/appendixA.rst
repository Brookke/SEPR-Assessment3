finding it hard to read some of the text, she is able to go through the
introductory tutorial without issue due to the text colour and
background colour contrast in a way to avoid issue with most forms of
colourblindness. She is able to see the clues quite clearly due to map
tile colours and clue item colours being chosen in a way so as to not
cause problems to most people will colourblindness. She is then able to
solve the crime quicker than most and accuse the correct murderer of the
crime on her first try thanks to her experience played puzzle games.

attempts to concentrate and solve the puzzle as quickly as possible so
as to get the high score, the background noise begins to bother him.

sidebar of the game and this allows him to continue playing comfortably.
Although he finishes the game with a good score, he is unable to beat
the high score and wishes to play again, fortunately due to the game
having a set of different characters from which murderers and victims
are chosen randomly, he can play several times whilst going through a
new, different and exciting storyline each time.
