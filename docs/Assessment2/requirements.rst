Requirements
============

**Highlighted changes:**

- All requirements have been reviewed and rewritten where appropriate
- IDs have changed due to recategorisation of requirements
- Improved introduction and document formatting
- More details are in the updates report

Introduction
-------------

At our first meeting we read the brief, and with that in mind, we played
cluedo to get a feel for a general detective game. This sparked
discussion as to what works in a game, and it gave us ideas for how our
game should work. We decided the most effective way of thinking about
the game was like “guess who”. Using the brief and our new ideas, we
produced a list of features we’d like to include in the game, and then
prioritised those.

After the initial meeting, we produced a number of user scenarios [1],
and used our list of features to help produce a draft of
the requirements. From these we identified ambiguous points and produced
questions we needed to get answers for. We met multiple times with the
customer throughout the  design process, to present our requirements and
ask questions we had. Using their feedback, we made any necessary
changes.

Following the response we got after the Assessment 1 feedback was
released, we decided it was best to rewrite our requirements. This lead
to substantial improvements in the clarity and categorisation of our
requirements, and this has benefitted us as it made the requirements
easier to test against when it came to implementing the game.

When designing the requirements, we took these points into account:

-  The requirements should be categorised as:

   -  Functional requirements - these define what the system should do
   -  Nonfunctional requirements - the define the behaviour of the system

-  The requirements should be achievable within the time allocated of
   this project
-  The requirements should consider the hardware in which the game
   should run
-  The requirements should meet all points included in the brief
-  We produced a survey asking about input methods and accessibility
   [2]. We got a sample of our target market to respond. From this we
   found:

-  The preferred way of interaction with the game was keyboard and
   mouse.
-  There were no results from colourblind people, however we still felt
   it was important that our game was accessible, so have included
   accessibility features as a “could” requirement. Colour blindness is
   a condition apparent in 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women [3] so we feel
   that it is a requirement that some people would benefit from.

The requirements are laid out in tables based on the IEEE standard for
system requirements, as we felt this was a good standard to adhere to.
The tables are split according to type (functional or non-functional),
and category. Some requirements have associated risks, these are
referenced in the table below, and are defined in the risks document .

Each requirement is given a unique identifier to make it easy to locate,
and for traceability. The identifiers are made up of three numbers,
using the following system:

-  The first number is category, this represents the functional area of
   the requirement
-  The second number represents how important the requirement is:

   -  1=Must implement
   -  2=Should implement
   -  3=Could implement

-  The third number is the position in the list, used to ensure the
   identifier is unique.
