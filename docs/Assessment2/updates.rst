Updates on Assessment 1
==========================

Requirements
---------------

What has changed, and why?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Based on feedback from the previous assessment, the entire requirements
specification has been reworked and looked at.

-  Almost all requirements have been changed and updated
-  We have updated each requirement to make them more concise and
   objective, in order to reduce the “design pollution”. This involved
   objectively reviewing each requirement and ensuring that they
   precisely specified the function or behaviour of the game
-  The format has remained the same, as we still use the IEEE standard
   for system requirements
-  We standardised and corrected our definitions of functional and
   nonfunctional requirements, and used these as a basis for
   categorising all of the requirements in the document.  From the
   feedback given we were made aware that our understanding of this was
   incorrect, so made have changes to correct these problems .
-  The idea and aims behind each of the requirements has remained
   largely unchanged
-  Any small changes to the description of individual requirements was
   due to re-evaluation of what that requirement was attempting to
   achieve.
-  The IDs of the requirements were modified to fit the changed
   categorisation
-  We continued to ensure the requirements referenced appropriate risks

Methods
-----------
What has changed?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although we as a group feel that sometimes change is necessary for a
group to run smoothly, we have not had much change occur during the
second assessment. However, we have agreed to change a few minor things,
allowing us to operate more efficiently as a team.

-  We are coding exclusively in IntelliJ while still ensuring that it
   can be opened, modified and run in Eclipse.
-  The group leader has changed to Jason.
-  Rather than 3 sub-groups, we are now operating more as singular
   units, sometimes pairing up to do more complicated tasks.
-  As the process went on, we found it easier to think in terms of tasks
   we had to do, rather than spend valuable time deciding on S.M.A.R.T
   targets per person. The document has been changed to reflect that
-  Systematic plan for Assessment 3 was added.
-  Following feedback, we have added a greater focus on the methods we
   are using for software engineering, as such a large portion of the
   document has been rewritten or adapted to better fit the brief
-  Improved section on how we are conducting meetings and sprints

Why has it changed?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Due to team preference, no-one in our group is coding using eclipse.
   This is also in part due to it being easier to discuss problems to do
   with coding interface (such as not being able to import the project
   correctly at the start) as everyone will see the same UI.
-  In our group we have had two leaders so far Brooke and Jason. The
   group unanimously decided that we would alternate leaders so that no
   one got overworked.
-  Due to the nature of coding and the amount of code to write, for this
   assessment we decided to split the work more than previously
   discussed to get more done in the same time. By ensuring that all
   work is still checked, this will ensure that we have more time spent
   on each part of the assessment so we will end up with a higher
   quality end product.
-  As a group we have decided that we work well together and can decide
   on our own tasks and goals well so felt that S.M.A.R.T targets were
   unnecessary to help us construct targets for the sprint ahead
-  We have elaborated on how we are going about software engineering
   using the agile-scrum methodology, and discussed further what we plan
   to do in our meetings and sprints. This should help the document
   better fit the brief.

Risk Management
-------------------
What has changed?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We feel that in the last assessment all major and minor risks were
outlined well so we do not feel the need to add any more or change them
in any way.

-  We did improve the introduction documentation to address points
   raised in the feedback we received. This included greater detail into
   the risk identification process.
-  We also introduced bullet points to aid with readability
-  We added an owner column to the risks table

Why has it changed?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This document has been updated to include this information as we felt
that it did not show enough detail in some elements of risk management.

Firstly the document did not describe how we actually determined the
risks outlined in the document, therefore we felt it necessary to
describe how we went about this.

Also the risks document did not show who actually had responsibility for
the risks that we identified. It is important to know who is responsible
so that if the risk does occur we know who will know how to deal with
it, for example if there were conflicts in Git we would know who knows
how to deal with them to resolve the issue quickly and efficiently.
